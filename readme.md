### Gradient Descent
This folder contains the implementation of 
- a Feed Forward Neural Network witha arbitrary shape
- the Gradient Descent algorithm to train the FFNN
### Parareal
This folder contains the implementation of the parallel in time Parareal algorithm to solve a system of ODEs
### Back_Propagation_Parareal
This folder contains the code that merges the implementation of the FFNN and the parareal algorithm.
